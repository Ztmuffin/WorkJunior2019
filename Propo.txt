My first Choice for a Project to work on would be the Aquarium Mascott.
It touches on every one of my main interests. Character design, modeling, rigging and especially animation.
As a second choice I would like to do the Build a Fish Project. As that touches on those same interests but a different scenario.
I want to go where I will be the most helpful, and where I will learn the most.
